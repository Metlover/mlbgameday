## Need to validate all internal gids...season by season, will take a while.

## Get inning_all formated like pitchRx.

## Test other data sets. Will have to write if statement in get_payload.

## Test with microbenchmark package.

## Using pitchRx update_gids function. Need to write our own.
## 
## Add methods for openWAR stuff that doesn't exist in pitchRx.
## 
## Add package data with playerIDs.
## 
## minor-league and pre-2008 have no inning all. Dependable mlb data goes back to 2005 with no inning_all.
## 
## Look at viz options but don't go nuts.
